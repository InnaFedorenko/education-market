Imagine a future where education is truly decentralized. The UniVersIty platform is a proof-of-concept (POC) project that brings passionate educators directly together with curious learners, eliminating intermediaries and barriers to learning. With UniVersIty, you can collaborate, share knowledge, and learn freely, fostering a community-driven educational ecosystem.

### Disclaimer
UniVersIty is a proof-of-concept (POC) project and may have limited functionality. It is intended to showcase the potential of a decentralized education platform. As a POC, it might not have all the features of a fully developed platform but serves as a starting point for further development and exploration.  
 We welcome contributions and feedback from the community to help shape the future of decentralized education.
